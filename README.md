# Personal Portfolio Website

## This project was created to showcase my projects and other passions, as well as to allow others to contact myself with ease.

The website itself is created with React + Vite and styled with the help of Claude AI using TailwindCSS.

(how is the website launched... what server hosting service...)

Through creating this project, I have sharpened my web development skill by further familiarizing myself with different TailwindCSS styles and
practice with HTML and JavaScript syntax. I have also learned (... talk about the process of server launching).
